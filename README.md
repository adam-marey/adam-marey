### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a certified Full-Stack Web Developer and current Computer Science student at the University of Arizona. If I were to describe myself in one word, it would be resourceful. Where there is a will there is a way and that is what I always keep in mind when coding. I always try to think outside the box and find creative ways to solve problems. If you asked me what keeps me motivated to continuously learn, I would say challenge all the way. I do the thing that scares me the most, proudly and patiently. What I love about coding is that it keeps me on my toes. It is a combination of frustration, happiness, uncharted territory, an amalgam of information and so much more. I would not have it any other way.
